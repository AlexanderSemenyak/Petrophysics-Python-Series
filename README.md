# Petrophysics-Python-Series
This series of Jupyter Notebooks take you through various aspects of working with Python and Petrophysical data.
A number of the notebooks are accompanied by either a Blog Post or a Medium article. You can find the full list on my website at:

**Check out the binder button below** if you want to run these notebooks without needing to download them or install Python.

## Data Sets Used

Data for each workbook can be found with this repo's Data sub folder.

All data has been obtained from publicly accessible data repositories. Details for the origins of each file is presented below.

#### Equinor Volve Dataset
- 15_9-19.csv
- 15_9-19A-CORE.csv
- 15-9-19_SR_COMP.LAS 
- VolveWells.csv

Information on the Volve dataset can be found at:
